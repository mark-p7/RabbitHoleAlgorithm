Original video idea: https://youtu.be/XEt09iK8IXs?t=1254

There are 100 holes ranging from 0 to 99
<br>
In one of these holes resides a bunny that likes jumping around.
<br><br>
The goal of this algorithm is to find the bunny in one of these holes.
<br>
#### Rules
1. Everytime the algorithm checks a hole, the bunny will always move by 1 hole
2. The bunny can only move to adjacent holes, eg: if the bunny is in hole 2, it can only move to 1 or 3
3. The bunny can only move between the ranges of 0 - 99
4. The bunny can start at any random number between the ranges of 0 - 99

## Solution
Solution to this algorithm is presented neatly in the RabbitHole.java file. With docstrings and a O(n) time complexity.
<br><br>
For those who would like to try this problem out, there is a Rabbit.java file that is available that doesn't contain any of the answer.
